			<h2>Upgrade</h2>
				<h3>Why are you upgrading your site?</h3>
					<p>We have out grown our old shopping cart softwares features, and it no longer povides us with the features we need.</p>
				<h3>Why do you need to take your site offline?</h3>
					<p>The support contact for the old shopping cart software expires on January 1st, 2025. We take IT security very seriously, and can not run our sit without receiving patching or support from the original sites developer. Our old shopping cart provider only provides contacts for 1 full year, and we are currently estimating to have our new site online before the renewed support contact would be due to expire.</p>

				<h3>Will you be migrating account data?</h3>
					<p>We will not be migrating order and account information from our previous system. The platform our new store is being build upon is not compatable with our new site</p>
